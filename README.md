email slicer with Python So we need to divide the email into two strings using ‘@’ as the separator. 

# Email Slicer with Python
To create an email slicer with Python, our task is to write a program that can retrieve the username and the domain name of the email. For example, look at the image below which shows the domain and username of “customer@gmail.com”

email slicer with Python So we need to divide the email into two strings using ‘@’ as the separator.We take user input and use the strip function at the same time to remove white space if any. Then we are finding the index of ‘@’ symbol of the user input. Then we store the index into a variable known as domain_name to split the email into two parts; the user name and the domain.
