BMI is a measure of relative weight based on an individual’s mass and height. Today, Body Mass Index is commonly used to classify people as underweight, overweight, and even with obesity. Also, it is adopted by countries to promote healthy eating.

BMI can be considered as an alternative for direct measurements of body fat. Besides, BMI is an inexpensive and easy-to-perform method of screening for weight classes that may cause health problems.

# BMI Calculator with Python
The body mass index is calculated by dividing an individual’s weight in kilograms by their height in meters, then dividing the answer again by their height. 
email slicer with Python So we need to divide the email into two strings using ‘@’ as the separator. 

# Email Slicer with Python

To create an email slicer with Python, our task is to write a program that can retrieve the username and the domain name of the email. For example, look at the image below which shows the domain and username of “customer@gmail.com”

email slicer with Python So we need to divide the email into two strings using ‘@’ as the separator.We take user input and use the strip function at the same time to remove white space if any. Then we are finding the index of ‘@’ symbol of the user input. Then we store the index into a variable known as domain_name to split the email into two parts; the user name and the domain.

# Python Program to Generate Password

To create a password with Python, we need to create a program that takes the length of the password and generates a random password of the same length.

To write a Python program to create a password, declare a string of numbers + uppercase + lowercase + special characters. Take a random sample of the string of a length given by the user.
Story Generator with Python
Our task is to generate a random story every time the user runs the program. I will first store the parts of the stories in different lists, then the Random module can be used to select the random parts of the story stored in different lists:

Steps:
I first imported the random module and then I created parts of the stories in different lists, then I only selected the parts of the lists at random to generate a random story.

As a beginner, you look for creating software applications more, which is not wrong. But spending more time with programs which required you to think logically will always help you no matter what aspect of programming interests you.
